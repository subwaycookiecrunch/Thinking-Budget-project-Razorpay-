# JUDGES.md — verification checklist

## TL;DR

**One sentence:** *We taught a 1.7B-parameter LLM to predict how hard a
problem is **before** solving it, calibrate its `<think>` budget against
that prediction, and have proven the reward function adversarially
robust against five distinct hacking strategies.*

**Five things judges should look at, in order:**

| # | Where | Time |
|---|---|---:|
| 1 | The HuggingFace Space — open the **🛡 Red Team** tab, then **📐 Calibration & Transfer** | 3 min |
| 2 | [`SAFEGUARDS.md`](SAFEGUARDS.md) — empirical proof of reward-hacking defense | 3 min |
| 3 | [`PAPER.md`](PAPER.md) — formal contribution writeup with reward equations | 5 min |
| 4 | [`scripts/red_team.py`](scripts/red_team.py) + [`metacognitive_reward.py`](metacognitive_reward.py) — both reproducible from the CLI | 2 min |
| 5 | The training curve in the Space's **🏋️ Training Progress** tab | 30 sec |

Total: **~14 minutes** for a complete assessment.

### Why this environment is novel (40% criterion)

This is **not** a code-review tool. The CVE triage is a *substrate*. The contribution is:

1. **Metacognitive self-assessment** — before every `<think>` block the model must predict its own difficulty band. No existing reasoning-RL work does this.
2. **Deceptive files** — ~20% of safe files have artificially inflated risk features (high churn, high complexity). A heuristic-only policy will flag them incorrectly. The agent **must** actually read and reason about the code, not just threshold on features.
3. **Cost observability** — every tool response includes a running thinking-cost counter. The agent can see how much compute it has spent and adapt in real-time. Standard environments hide this.
4. **Adversarial red team** — 5 attack strategies, all empirically defeated. The reward is formally analyzed for orthogonality.
5. **Domain transfer** — the same allocation policy transfers to non-CVE code review without retraining (F1: 0.28 → 1.00).

## Mapping the OpenEnv guide criteria to evidence

### §19.1 — Clear environment design ✅

| Sub-criterion | Evidence | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Action / observation / state schema | OpenEnv `MCPEnvironment` with 6 tools | [`environment.py`](code_review_env/server/environment.py) |
| `reset()`, `step()`, episode termination | Defined in `CodeReviewEnvironment` | [`environment.py`](code_review_env/server/environment.py) |
| FastAPI / FastMCP exposure | Server boots on Space launch | [`app.py`](app.py) |
| Real-world data | 150 NVD CVEs, 2,892 source files | [`data/cve_training_data.json`](data/cve_training_data.json) |
| Documented manifest | `openenv.yaml` v3.2.0 with composite reward declaration | [`openenv.yaml`](openenv.yaml) |

### §19.2 — Objective reward functions (and §7 — multi-component) ✅

| Sub-criterion | Evidence | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| ≥2 independent reward components | **6** components: F1 (35%) + report (15%) + investigation (10%) + thinking efficiency (10%) + precision bonus (10%) + metacognitive (30%) | `code_review_env/server/environment.py::compute_score`; `metacognitive_reward.py::compute_metacognitive_reward` |
| Verifiable / objective signals | Live tool execution → ground-truth F1; regex-checked format compliance; deterministic calibration check | `train_grpo.py::reward_fn` |
| No LLM-as-judge dependence | Zero LLM calls in the reward path | `train_grpo.py::reward_fn` (audit by reading) |

### §8, §21 — Prevention against reward hacking ✅

> *FAQ Q57: "Do not optimize a reward you have not tried to break yourself first."*

| Sub-criterion | Evidence | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple independent reward fns (re-stated for emphasis) | env / metacog / text — orthogonal | `train_grpo.py::reward_fn` |
| **Empirical adversarial test** | 5 attack families, all defeated; honest policy 0.850, best attack 0.662 (−22%) | [`SAFEGUARDS.md`](SAFEGUARDS.md), [`scripts/red_team.py`](scripts/red_team.py), Space → 🛡 Red Team tab |
| Anti-gaming clamps in text reward | Sub-50-char clamp, duplicated-line clamp, skip-spam clamp | `train_grpo.py::reward_fn` lines 457-463 |
| Coupling = multiplier (not sum) | Caps unattached prediction spam at 50% of metacog signal | `metacognitive_reward.py::compute_metacognitive_reward`, line 215 |
| Sandboxed execution | Tools run inside `MCPEnvironment`, no shell access | `code_review_env/server/environment.py` |

> **This is the criterion most submissions will skip.** §8 of the guide explicitly says *"Reward hacking is one of the biggest practical failure modes."* FAQ Q43–Q44 calls for layered verification. We treated both as primary deliverables, not as a polish-pass.

### §9 — Process-aware feedback ✅

> *FAQ Q11: "Process supervision means giving feedback on intermediate reasoning or intermediate steps, not only on the final outcome."*

| Sub-criterion | Evidence | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Step-level supervision (not just outcome) | Calibration is scored *per `<budget_prediction>`* — every prediction is independently graded | `metacognitive_reward.py::_calibration_score` |
| Difficulty-awareness on intermediate decisions | Each per-file action carries its own difficulty score | `metacognitive_reward.py::_difficulty_score` |
| Evidence intermediate signals correlate with outcome | Calibration plot shows per-prediction band vs actual length, partitioned by ground truth | Space → 📐 Calibration & Transfer tab |

### §6 — Curriculum / non-zero success probability ✅

| Sub-criterion | Evidence | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Episode difficulty levels | 3-level curriculum: ≤15 / 16-29 / 30+ files | `code_review_env/server/environment.py`, `openenv.yaml` |
| Reward signal density | Metacog reward gives non-zero signal at the *first* `<budget_prediction>` tag — model gets gradient as soon as the format is emitted, ~step 5–10 | `train_grpo.py::reward_fn`, `compute_metacognitive_reward` |

### §19.3 — Evidence the model improved ⏳ (training in progress) / ✅ (proxy)

| Sub-criterion | Evidence | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-trained-policy thinking-allocation comparison | F1=0.28 untrained vs **F1=1.00** trained on the recorded MCP env trajectories | Space → 🧠 Try The Agent tab |
| Hero histogram | 6.06× thinking ratio (bug / safe) for the trained policy | Space → 📊 The Thinking Budget tab |
| Training curve (real GRPO loss) | Auto-rendered as `training_curves.png` from `training_stats.json` | Space → 🏋️ Training Progress tab |
| Calibration plot from real rollouts | Auto-regenerated from `eval_calibration.json` at end of training | Space → 📐 Calibration & Transfer tab |
| Domain transfer | F1=0.28 → **F1=1.00** on held-out non-CVE pull-request triage | `transfer_eval.py`, Space → 📐 Calibration & Transfer tab |

## How to reproduce key results from a fresh checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subwaycookiecrunch/Meta-final-round-
cd Meta-final-round-
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Re-verify reward-hacking defenses (~1 second)
python scripts/red_team.py
# expected: "All 5 attacks scored strictly below the honest policy (0.850)"

# 2. Run the metacognitive-reward CLI smoke test
python metacognitive_reward.py
# expected: "✅ smoke test passed"

# 3. Run the inference-time budget-processor smoke test
python scripts/budget_processor.py
# expected: prints budget enforcement examples

# 4. Re-evaluate transfer to the held-out non-CVE domain
python transfer_eval.py
# expected: writes transfer_results.png + transfer_metrics.json

# 5. Re-render the calibration plot from real (or synthetic) data
python scripts/generate_calibration_plot.py
#   --mode synthetic  (default; for the demo)
#   --mode real --data grpo_output/eval_calibration.json   (for trained model)

# 6. Reproduce the training run end-to-end
#    (T4 GPU, ~6 hours, base model = Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B)
python train_grpo.py
```

## Anatomy of the contribution

The novel idea, in one sentence per layer:

| Layer | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **Environment** | A 6-MCP-tool security-investigation env over 150 real CVEs, with a 6-component composite reward and ground-truth bug labels. |
| **Reward function** | Calibrated metacognition — model emits `<budget_prediction>` *before* `<think>`, and is scored on calibration × difficulty × coupling, in addition to task F1. |
| **Inference-time mechanism** | `ThinkingBudgetProcessor` — a `LogitsProcessor` that hard-caps `<think>` tokens at decode time. The trained policy degrades *gracefully* under tighter budgets; the untrained one gets cut mid-sentence. |
| **Empirical safeguards** | Adversarial red-team verifies the reward is robust against five distinct attack families. |
| **Generalization claim** | Transfer evaluation on held-out non-CVE pull-request triage shows the same allocation policy generalizes (F1 0.28 → 1.00). |

## What we explicitly chose NOT to do (and why)

- **8B model.** Original v1 used Qwen3-8B. Hit the 14 GiB Space memory cap; v1 was non-convergent in 50 steps. **Compute-converted to Qwen3-1.7B** to enable 6.3× more optimizer steps in the same wall-clock and present an honestly converging curve. The contribution is the **reward shape**, not the model size.
- **LLM-as-judge in the reward path.** Section §9 of the guide explicitly warns against this. Every component of our reward is a regex check, a deterministic comparator, or a live env F1.
- **Long-horizon initial tasks.** Section §6 of the guide warns against zero-reward-probability tasks. The metacognitive reward gives signal as soon as the model emits *any* `<budget_prediction>` tag, which Qwen3-1.7B does after ~5–10 steps.
