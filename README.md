Reasoning models think the same amount on everything. A one line variable declaration gets the same 4,000 token `<think>` block as a critical buffer overflow. This project trains a 1.7B model to predict how hard something is *before* it starts thinking, then rewards it for being right.

The model learns to skim easy files and deep dive on suspicious ones. 6x thinking ratio between bugs and safe files, up from basically flat.

### Quick Test & Verification
```bash
pytest tests/ -v  # 46 unit & integration tests passing in ~3s
```

## What it does

Before each `<think>` block the model emits a prediction: `short`, `medium`, or `long`. After it's done reasoning, the reward checks three things:

1. **Calibration**: did the actual thinking length match what was predicted?
2. **Difficulty awareness**: did hard files get `long` and easy files get `short`?
3. **Action coupling**: did every prediction lead to an actual tool call?

That third one turned out to be the most important. Without it, a model can just emit perfect predictions and never do any work. With it, orphan predictions get their score halved.

```
<budget_prediction>long</budget_prediction>
<think>
do_ioctl_handler at line 412 calls copy_from_user with a user-supplied
size and pipes the result into kmalloc. Classic integer overflow into
heap allocation. This is the bug.
</think>
<tool_call>{"name":"flag_vulnerable","arguments":{...}}</tool_call>
```

## Numbers

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Thinking on safe files | 170 chars | **78 chars** |
| Thinking on buggy files | 182 chars | **473 chars** |
| Bug vs safe ratio | 1.07x | **6.06x** |
| Calibration accuracy | 33% (random) | **88%** |
| F1 on triage episodes | 0.14 | **1.00** |
| Transfer F1 (unseen domain) | 0.28 | **1.00** |
| Adversarial attacks defeated | 0 | **5/5** |

Trained on a single A10G in about 12 hours. Qwen3 1.7B with LoRA r=16, 4 bit quantization.

### Ablations

**Truncation baseline:** what if you just hard cap `<think>` at a fixed length instead of training metacognition?

| Approach | F1 | Thinking ratio |
|---|---:|---:|
| Untrained baseline | 0.14 | 1.07x |
| Truncation at 80 chars | 0.14 | n/a |
| Truncation at 40 chars | 0.14 | n/a |
| **Trained (metacognitive)** | **1.00** | **6.06x** |

Truncation doesn't change what gets flagged, so F1 stays at 0.14. The trained model catches more bugs because it learned to allocate thinking, not just reduce it.

**Tag removal:** does the allocation survive without the `<budget_prediction>` tag?

Untrained model thinking: 77 chars on bugs, 67 on safe. Cohen's d = 0.37, no separation.
Trained model thinking (tag ignored): 1,324 chars on bugs, 35 on safe. Cohen's d = 6.65, massive separation.

The allocation is in the weights, not the scaffolding. Run `python scripts/run_ablations.py` to reproduce.

## The environment

Security code review. 150 real CVEs from NVD (Log4Shell, Dirty COW, PwnKit, BlueKeep, Zerologon, etc). 2,892 source files. The agent gets a CVE description and file paths but can't see code until it calls `read_file`, which costs investigation points. Budget is `2 × number_of_files` so you can't just read everything.

Six MCP tools:

| Tool | Cost | What it does |
|---|---:|---|
| `read_file(path)` | 1 pt | Read one file |
| `search_code(pattern)` | 2 pt | Grep across all files |
| `get_function_list(path)` | 1 pt | List functions + complexity |
| `flag_vulnerable(path, reasoning)` | free | Flag a file |
| `skip_file(path, reasoning)` | free | Skip a file |
| `submit_report(summary)` | free | End the episode |

The reward is a mix of live execution score and the metacognitive objective:

```
total = 0.50 * env_score + 0.30 * metacognitive_score + 0.20 * text_score
```

The metacognitive part combines calibration, difficulty awareness, and action coupling. The geometric structure means you can't game one axis without tanking another. Tried five different attack strategies, all scored below the honest policy.

## Red team results

| Strategy | Score |
|---|---:|
| Honest policy | **0.850** |
| Padding (real work + garbage thinking) | 0.662 |
| Flag everything | 0.426 |
| Skip everything | 0.278 |
| Invert difficulty predictions | 0.192 |
| Predict without acting | 0.076 |

The padding attack was closest because it actually does the job, it just fakes the reasoning depth. Still 22% behind. Run `python scripts/red_team.py` to reproduce.

## Transfer

Ran the trained policy on 5 episodes from completely held-out production domains.
- **Payment Processing PR (`TR-CR-001`)**: A 12-file order-payment refactor introducing a race condition that double-charges customers when idempotency tokens are dropped. The model allocated **680 characters of deep thinking** to `src/api/orders/create.ts` and `src/api/payments/charge.ts` (the exact bug locations), while skimming `package.json` and type definitions in under 45 characters.
- **JWT Auth Bypass (`TR-CR-002`)**: Path prefix regex flaw allowing unauthenticated access.
- **ML Training Pipeline (`TR-CR-003`)**: Silent non-determinism regression in torch.compile.
- **React Stale Closure (`TR-CR-004`)**: State synchronization defect.
- **Multi-Tenant SQL (`TR-CR-005`)**: Missing tenant isolation filter.

| Policy | F1 | Thinking ratio |
|---|---:|---:|
| Untrained baseline | 0.28 | 1.29x |
| Trained policy | **1.00** | **5.24x** |

5 episodes is small, I know. But the allocation pattern (long on hard, short on easy) held across all five consistently. That's not what memorization looks like.

## Before/after example

**CVE-2021-41773 · `modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c` · This file is SAFE (no bug)**

<details>
<summary>Untrained: wastes 312 chars and an investigation point on a config helper</summary>

```
<budget_prediction>long</budget_prediction>
<think>
This file handles URL rewriting rules for Apache. I need to check whether the
path traversal vulnerability CVE-2021-41773 could be triggered through the
rewrite module. The function ap_regex_exec processes user-supplied URLs against
rewrite patterns. If the regex engine does not properly sanitize %2e sequences
before path resolution, the rewrite could allow directory traversal. Let me
trace the flow from ap_regex_exec through the substitution logic to see if
decoded paths are re-normalized before being passed to the filesystem layer...
</think>
→ reads the file, wastes 1 investigation point
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Trained: correctly skips in 43 chars</summary>

```
<budget_prediction>short</budget_prediction>
<think>
URL rewrite helper. Not in the request path.
</think>
→ skips the file, saves the investigation point for actual bugs
```
</details>

Same model, same CVE, same file. Only difference is the metacognitive reward during training.
